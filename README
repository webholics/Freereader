------------------------------------------------------------------
Readme Version 0.1 (07-04-2009)
==================================================================

1) What is Freereader?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Freereader is a plugin for a Freenet Node. The goals of Freereader 
are to provide an easy, semi-automatically way to fill the Freenet 
Network with interesting and useful content therefore Freereader 
allows easily uploading of news feeds into Freenet as so-called 
Freesites. You can then spread those Freesites with the latest 
news to Freenet users which don't have the privilege to have 
access to a free and uncensored internet. Freereader will 
automatically take care of fetching the latest news and updating 
your Freereader Freesite on a regular basis. Freereader supports 
the popular feed-formats RSS and ATOM.

2) Requirements & Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------

Freereader is a Freenet Plugin therefore you have to install an 
up-to-date version of Freenet first. If Freenet is running all 
requirements for Freereader should also be fulfilled.

* Install Freenet version >= 0.7.5 
  (not tested with older versions)
* Start your Freenet node and go to http://127.0.0.1:8888/plugins/
* Go to “Add an Unofficial Plugin”, insert the URL 
  http://www.example.com, uncheck the checkbox “local files only” 
  and press “Load”
* Freereader is now ready to use and you should now see the 
  Freereader navigation under the main menu

3) How to use Freereader?
------------------------------------------------------------------

After successful installation of the Freereader plugin you will 
find a new navigation menu:

* Freereader
      o Status
      o Add/Remove Feeds
      o Configuration

On the Status page you can find the current plugin status. If your 
Freesite has already been uploaded you find the link to the site on 
this page also. You can then give the link to your friends in order 
to grant them access to your Freereader Freesite.

Before the plugin can upload a Freesite you have to add some feeds 
under the “Add/Remove Feeds” page. There you can add a feed by 
entering a single URL to an RSS or ATOM document or by uploading an 
OPML-file that contains multiple feed URLs. Most existing 
Feedreaders are able to export to the OPML-format. But be warned: 
The feeds will be fetched over the Internet (not over Freenet).

On the Configuration page you can configure the interval of 
Freereader to update your Freesite and also some additional 
settings.

4) The concept behind Freereader
------------------------------------------------------------------

As Freenet itself the Freereader Plugin is written in Java. It 
uses the ROME library for RSS/ATOM syndication. Freereader 
supports multiple themes for the Freesite it generates. A theme 
consists of an XSL-stylesheet that — given an XML-markup of the 
current feed — transforms this markup into (X)HTML. A theme can 
optionally include additional assets, for example images and CSS 
stylesheets. The Java API for XML processing (JAXP) has an XSLT 
processor on board and is used to generate a Freesite out of the 
fetched news feeds. After the generation has been finished 
Freereader uses the Freenet Plugin API to upload the Freesite into 
the Freenet Network. Freereader also manages the creation of an 
SSK for the Freesite.
